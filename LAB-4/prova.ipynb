      "['In common usage and medicine, health, according to the World Health Organization, is \"a state of complete physical, mental and social well-being and not merely the absence of disease and infirmity\".', '[1] A variety of definitions have been used for different purposes over time.', 'Health can be promoted by encouraging healthful activities, such as regular physical exercise and adequate sleep,[2] and by reducing or avoiding unhealthful activities or situations, such as smoking or excessive stress.', 'Some factors affecting health are due to individual choices, such as whether to engage in a high-risk behavior, while others are due to structural causes, such as whether the society is arranged in a way that makes it easier or harder for people to get necessary healthcare services.', 'Still, other factors are beyond both individual and group choices, such as genetic disorders.', 'The meaning of health has evolved over time.', \"In keeping with the biomedical perspective, early definitions of health focused on the theme of the body's ability to function; health was seen as a state of normal function that could be disrupted from time to time by disease.\", 'An example of such a definition of health is: \"a state characterized by anatomic, physiologic, and psychological integrity; ability to perform personally valued family, work, and community roles; ability to deal with physical, biological, psychological, and social stress\".', '[3] Then, in 1948, in a radical departure from previous definitions, the World Health Organization (WHO) proposed a definition that aimed higher, linking health to well-being, in terms of \"physical, mental, and social well-being, and not merely the absence of disease and infirmity\".', '[4] Although this definition was welcomed by some as being innovative, it was also criticized for being vague and excessively broad and was not construed as measurable.', 'For a long time, it was set aside as an impractical ideal, with most discussions of health returning to the practicality of the biomedical model.', '[5]\\nJust as there was a shift from viewing disease as a state to thinking of it as a process, the same shift happened in definitions of health.', 'Again, the WHO played a leading role when it fostered the development of the health promotion movement in the 1980s.', 'This brought in a new conception of health, not as a state, but in dynamic terms of resiliency, in other words, as \"a resource for living\".', 'In 1984, WHO revised the definition of health defined it as \"the extent to which an individual or group is able to realize aspirations and satisfy needs and to change or cope with the environment.', 'Health is a resource for everyday life, not the objective of living; it is a positive concept, emphasizing social and personal resources, as well as physical capacities.', '\"[6] Thus, health referred to the ability to maintain homeostasis and recover from adverse events.', \"Mental, intellectual, emotional and social health referred to a person's ability to handle stress, to acquire skills, to maintain relationships, all of which form resources for resiliency and independent living.\", '[5] This opens up many possibilities for health to be taught, strengthened and learned.', \"Since the late 1970s, the federal Healthy People Program has been a visible component of the United States' approach to improving population health.\", '[7][8] In each decade, a new version of Healthy People is issued,[9] featuring updated goals and identifying topic areas and quantifiable objectives for health improvement during the succeeding ten years, with assessment at that point of progress or lack thereof.', 'Progress has been limited to many objectives, leading to concerns about the effectiveness of Healthy People in shaping outcomes in the context of a decentralized and uncoordinated US health system.', 'Healthy People 2020 gives more prominence to health promotion and preventive approaches and adds a substantive focus on the importance of addressing social determinants of health.', 'A new expanded digital interface facilitates use and dissemination rather than bulky printed books as produced in the past.', 'The impact of these changes to Healthy People will be determined in the coming years.', '[10]\\nSystematic activities to prevent or cure health problems and promote good health in humans are undertaken by health care providers.', 'Applications with regard to animal health are covered by the veterinary sciences.', 'The term \"healthy\" is also widely used in the context of many types of non-living organizations and their impacts for the benefit of humans, such as in the sense of healthy communities, healthy cities or healthy environments.', \"In addition to health care interventions and a person's surroundings, a number of other factors are known to influence the health status of individuals.\", 'These are referred to as the \"determinants of health\", which include the individual\\'s background, lifestyle, economic status, social conditions and spirituality; Studies have shown that high levels of stress can affect human health.', '[11]\\nIn the first decade of the 21st century, the conceptualization of health as an ability opened the door for self-assessments to become the main indicators to judge the performance of efforts aimed at improving human health.', '[12] It also created the opportunity for every person to feel healthy, even in the presence of multiple chronic diseases or a terminal condition, and for the re-examination of determinants of health (away from the traditional approach that focuses on the reduction of the prevalence of diseases).', '[13]\\nThe dog (Canis familiaris[4][5] or Canis lupus familiaris[5]) is a domesticated descendant of the wolf.', \"Also called the domestic dog, it is derived from extinct Pleistocene wolves,[6][7] and the modern wolf is the dog's nearest living relative.\", '[8] Dogs were the first species to be domesticated[9][8] by hunter-gatherers over 15,000 years ago[7] before the development of agriculture.', '[1] Due to their long association with humans, dogs have expanded to a large number of domestic individuals[10] and gained the ability to thrive on a starch-rich diet that would be inadequate for other canids.', '[11]\\nThe dog has been selectively bred over millennia for various behaviors, sensory capabilities, and physical attributes.', '[12] Dog breeds vary widely in shape, size, and color.', 'They perform many roles for humans, such as hunting, herding, pulling loads, protection, assisting police and the military, companionship, therapy, and aiding disabled people.', 'Over the millennia, dogs became uniquely adapted to human behavior, and the human–canine bond has been a topic of frequent study.', '[13] This influence on human society has given them the sobriquet of \"man\\'s best friend\".', '[14]\\nIn 1758, the Swedish botanist and zoologist Carl Linnaeus published in his Systema Naturae, the two-word naming of species (binomial nomenclature).', 'Canis is the Latin word meaning \"dog\",[15] and under this genus, he listed the domestic dog, the wolf, and the golden jackal.', 'He classified the domestic dog as Canis familiaris and, on the next page, classified the grey wolf as Canis lupus.', '[2] Linnaeus considered the dog to be a separate species from the wolf because of its upturning tail (cauda recurvata), which is not found in any other canid.', '[16]\\nIn 1999, a study of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) indicated that the domestic dog may have originated from the grey wolf, with the dingo and New Guinea singing dog breeds having developed at a time when human communities were more isolated from each other.', '[17] In the third edition of Mammal Species of the World published in 2005, the mammalogist W. Christopher Wozencraft listed under the wolf Canis lupus its wild subspecies and proposed two additional subspecies, which formed the domestic dog clade: familiaris, as named by Linnaeus in 1758 and, dingo named by Meyer in 1793.', 'Wozencraft included hallstromi (the New Guinea singing dog) as another name (junior synonym) for the dingo.', 'Wozencraft referred to the mtDNA study as one of the guides informing his decision.', '[3] Mammalogists have noted the inclusion of familiaris and dingo together under the \"domestic dog\" clade[18] with some debating it.', \"[19]\\nIn 2019, a workshop hosted by the IUCN/Species Survival Commission's Canid Specialist Group considered the dingo and the New Guinea singing dog to be feral Canis familiaris and therefore did not assess them for the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species.\", '[4]']\n",
